On 23rd December 2024, we have listened to industry talk via Webex recording. 
The talk has 2 speakers. 
The first speaker was Encik Nik Mohd Habibullah, chief executive officer of Micro Semiconductor Sdn. Bhd.. 
The second speaker was Encik Mohd Hakimi Iqmall, information technology officer of UTMDigital.

The talk has opened my eyes about the importance of technical skills and soft skills in the IT industry. 
A person who work in this field needs to master in problem solving and catching up with the latest trend of technology. 
The person will also be involved in project management, thus making effective communication and empathy a vital skills one needs to adapt with.

As the talk was recorded, I do hope someday I obtain the opportunity to listen to these amazing speakers talk in person as I want to know more about the life of people in IT industry.
