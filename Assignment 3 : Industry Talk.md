On 23rd December 2024, we have listened to industry talk via Webex recording. 
The talk has 2 speakers. 
The first speaker was Encik Nik Mohd Habibullah, chief executive officer of Micro Semiconductor Sdn. Bhd.. 
The second speaker was Encik Mohd Hakimi Iqmall, information technology officer of UTMDigital. 

The talk has opened my eyes to the importance of mastering problem-solving and staying updated with the latest technological trends. 
These skills not only enhance individual performance but also contribute to the overall growth of the industry.  

Additionally, Being able to collaborate with diverse teams and understand different perspectives is crucial for delivering successful projects. 
This has motivated me to work on improving my interpersonal skills alongside my technical expertise.
