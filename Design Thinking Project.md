In the design thinking project, we were given a topic to solve; innovation for disadvantage group. 
We have to build something that can ease the daily life of the disadvantage group including disabled person and elderly.

My group, Group 4 has decided to focus on solving the problem that senior citizens often face which is buying groceries. 
We came up with the idea to build a mobile application called GROCER4U. 
GROCER4U is a grocery delivery service that has features like tracking expiration dates of food items and suggesting healthy recipes based on the purchase, the app simplifies daily life, making it easier for elderly individuals to enjoy fresh meals without the worry of running out of essentials or forgetting about expired items. 
By providing these services, GROCER4U able to help the elderly to stay independent, healthy, and connected, all while eliminating the stress of traditional grocery shopping.

After few discussions and presenting our ideas, we received several questions regarding our project.

Question 1 : How will you promote the app to the senior citizen as we all know they're not that friendly with mobile gadgets?
Answer 1 : We planned to introduce our app by monetizing it through social medias that younger generations often use. They might introduce the app to their parents, especially the one who live far away from their hometown, to ease the burden of the parents to buy groceries. If the parents satisfied with our services, they might introduce it to their friends. That's how we plan to promote our app.

Question 2 : How much the delivery cost?
Answer 2 : It depends on the distance and hour. If the order took place at peak hour, such as 12pm to 2pm, the delivery cost might increase compare to non peak hour. For example, 9 am.

We also received several feedback for this project. We accept the feedback and will try to improve our service.
