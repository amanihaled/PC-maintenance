On 17 December 2024, we went to UTMDigital to know more about the working's environment in IT field. 
At first, I expected the typical corporate environment—piles of files, dull colors, and a standard office vibe. 
But UTMDigital completely shattered that expectation. 
The space was surprisingly vibrant and full of color, with even an outdoor room where workers could relax after a long day.

Everyone I met there was incredibly friendly and helpful. 
They also took the time to share valuable insights about the facilities and offered a great perspective on how IT professionals approach their work. 
One of the coolest things I saw was the smart board. 
It made me realize how technology can make sharing ideas sessions much easier. 
The board can sync with other devices, making it perfect for meetings and presentations.

Overall, visiting UTMDigital and attending the talk helped me deepen my understanding by showing me how the concepts I’m learning are applied in the real world, and it also sparked excitement in me to pursue a career in the IT field.
