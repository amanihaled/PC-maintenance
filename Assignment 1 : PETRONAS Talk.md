On 10 November 2024, we listened to online talk from PETRONAS to get an overview of ICT jobs in the industry. 

The talk was very insightful as the speaker explained about PETRONAS Digital and emerging jobs in ICT. 
PETRONAS Digital focused on digital transformation, offering PETRONAS Digital Young Graduate Program (YGP) for fresh graduate.
The emerging jobs include software engineer, data engineering, and data scientist.

The talk also highlight the employment value in PETRONAS that include growth opportunities, work-life balance, continuous learning support and career advancement.
I do hope one day I am able to attend PETRONAS talk in physical since I have multiple questions to ask them regarding importance of IT in oil and gas industry.
