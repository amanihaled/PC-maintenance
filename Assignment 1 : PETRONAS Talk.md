On 10 November 2024, we listened to online talk from PETRONAS to get an overview of ICT jobs in the industry. 

The talk was very insightful as the speaker explained about PETRONAS Digital and description of the emerging jobs in ICT. 
PETRONAS Digital focused on digital transformation, offering PETRONAS Digital Young Graduate Program (YGP) for fresh graduate.
The emerging jobs include software engineer, data engineering, and data scientist.

The talk also highlight the employment value in PETRONAS that include trust, growth opportunities, diverse reward systems, support for continuous learning and career advancement, and work-life balance. 
Next time, I really hope that I can listen to the talk in-person as I have a lot of questions to ask to the speaker.
