On 5 February 2025, my group, Group 4 have listened to a cybersecurity talk.

The talk deepened my understanding of IR4.0 and its impact on industries of a country. 
It also discussed about Malaysia’s readiness for IR4.0, highlighting the problem that local IT industries faced.  

I was particularly inspired by the role of cybersecurity in securing Malaysia’s digital platform. 
Learning about government services like Cyber CSI and MyCERT has encouraged me to explore cybersecurity as a potential career path.  

Finally, the talk also emphasis on continuous improvement and professional branding. 
For example, updating LinkedIn and GitHub with every project we have done. 
This is important for career development and creating connection with people in the IT field.
